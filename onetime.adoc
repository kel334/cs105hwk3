You know all of those stories?
The ones that start with "one time, this guy I knew..."?

 They are quite the crazy phenomenon. Everyone has a one time story.
 Even I have one time stories, and I never leave my house!
 How does this keep happening?

 I'll tell you.
 People are just crazy, absolutely crazy.
 You can find people doing crazy things online, in person,
 Even in a grocery store! (Though, grocery stores are pretty crazy.)

 Here's a REALLY bad one that I have:
 One time, this girl I knew had a crazy story every time we met up.
 She would go on dates with too many guys, go to parties, or just a
 Starbucks incident that she had. One of these times, it was all three,
 And that was the least exciting thing that happened to her all week!
 For me, this was more excitement than a whole year of my life.
 She's crazy.

What was the point of this?
There was none, except for that this was fun!
