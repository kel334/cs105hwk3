Some fun excerpts :)

F SCOTT FITZGERALD:
 "' Gatsby believed in the green light, the organstic future that year
 by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter-
 tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And
 then one fine morning- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne
 back ceaselessly into the past. '"


JD SALINGER:
 "' Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody. '"


OSCAR WILDE:
 "' Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you.
 Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing. '"
