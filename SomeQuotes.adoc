Since we can put almost whatever we want here and I am not creative 
in terms of literature I will just put in some of my favorite Douglas Adams quotes.

1 I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.

2 I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.

3 The story so far:
In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

4 There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, 
it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened.

5 The major problem—one of the major problems, 
for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; 
or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.
To summarize: 
it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the summary: 
anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.

6 I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
	1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
	2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
	3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

7 It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, 
simply because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. 
However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. 
Any finite number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, 
so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. 
From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, 
and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.
