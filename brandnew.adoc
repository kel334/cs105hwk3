LYRICS:

 Song: Cold Water by Erik Nordblad

Barely holding my head above the surface
She don't mind the cold water
I'll keep on trying but my heart is closed up
She'll be dancing in the rain while I
I will drown in cold water.

Til' the sun comes up I love the way you hold my head up
Til' the sun comes up, oh I think the rain's pouring down
Til' the sun comes up, oh I think my tide is turning
She'll be by my side through it all, til' the sun comes up

Middle of the night still you shine so bright
How do you do it, how do you find the light
She don't seem to mind the world is crumbling down
She'll be dancing in debris while I
I'll be crushed under the concrete

Til' the sun comes up, I love the way you hold my head up
Til' the sun comes up, oh I think the rain's done pouring down
Til' the sun comes up, oh I think my tide is turing
She'll be by my side through it all, til' the sun comes up.



And a special thank you to my brain, for playing this on loop
