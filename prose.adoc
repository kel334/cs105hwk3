Hello, this story is to be continued.
But it shall be a dashing tale of bravery and truth.
It'll remind us of the stories of our youth.
From the Disney-ified Snow White and Rapunzel to Shrek,
It'll be brought up as a modern classic.

But what does consistute a modern classic?
The hero's journey? Dark Grimm brothers-esque content?
Or perhaps a convoluted moral to the story that can be debated?
Should it be written like a nursery rhyme? Like a short story?
Or should it be formed like a summer camp campfire story?

Should it be easy to adapt? Easy to parody?
Would that remove some of the value, or add to it?
Or should it be as long as War and Peace?
What would it matter anyways to anyone with common sense?
Or it could be an oral story, one with a home on the internet?

Why is writing so hard?
All the technicalities and all of the decisions.
But all I want is for the characters to leap off of the pages,
And for them to find a home in people's hearts.
Is that so hard?

Yes.
