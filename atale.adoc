So many things to say and so little time. Thus is the life of a writer.
The characters live in our heads, our hearts, our worlds.
And yet, until the words are in ink, no one else can find them.
What is it like, to go through life without seeing a story everywhere?
How can someone not find the words to narrate the scene?

I cannot imagine being that alone, that speechless.
It sounds like a void, pulling and tugging and shrieking relentlessly.
It spins and spins and spins, but does not let go.
The void is inside, how can it let go?

I ride with dragons, fight with warriors, laugh with travel companions.
You can't expect me to accept the mundane when I can see the fantastical.
It's not just words on a page of dead tree, it's so much more.

Join me in a world of wonder, let's leave this one behind. Trust me.
It's perfectly safe, it'll be the time of your life.

I'm not a fae.
